            <h1>Computing Courses</h1>
            <p>The College offers a range of courses to suit applicants with varying backgrounds and educational 
                abilities. At undergraduate level, there are single BSc Honours Degree courses in Computing, 
                Business Computing, Software Engineering and Information Systems Design.Computing is also a 
                subject offered on the Combined Honours Programme. Higher National Diploma and Certificate 
                courses are available in Business Information Technology and Computing. Students taking up 
                the HND in Computing can specialise in either Business Computing, Software Engineering or 
                Information Systems Design. The courses are British Computer Society accredited and 
                are highly relevant to modern industry. They are designed to prepare students for 
                professional occupations in Computing and related fields. Many graduates continue their
